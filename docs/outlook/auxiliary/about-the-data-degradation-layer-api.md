# About the Data Degradation Layer API

The Data Degradation Layer API provides the ability to hide the underlying native character format of an Outlook object, allowing a client to access the object in a preferred character format rather than in the object's native character format. It provides the constant definitions shown in [Constants (Data degradation layer API)](constants-data-degradation-layer-api.md), and the function [HrCreateNewWrappedObject](hrcreatenewwrappedobject.md) that returns an Outlook object wrapped in a specified format.
