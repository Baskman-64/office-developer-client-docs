```cpp
typedef struct _DTBLEDIT

  ULONG ulNumCharsAllowed;
  ULONG ulPropTag;
} DTBLEDIT, FAR *LPDTBLEDIT;

## Members

 **ulbLpszCharsAllowed**
  
> An offset from the start of the **DTBLEDIT** structure to a character string filter that describes restrictions, if any, to the characters that can be entered into the edit control. The filter is not interpreted as a regular expression and the same filter is applied to every character entered. The format of the filter is as follows:

|**Character**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| `*`   |Any character is allowed (for example, `"*"`). |
| `[ ]` |Defines a set of characters (for example, `"[0123456789]".`) |
| `-`   |Indicates a range of characters (for example, `"[a-z]"`). |
| `~`   |Indicates that these characters are not allowed (for example, `"[~0-9]"`). |
| `\`   |Used to quote any of the previous symbols (for example, `"[\-\\\[\]]"` means -, \, [, and ] characters are allowed). |

 **ulFlags**
  
> Bitmask of flags used to designate the format of the character filter. The following flag can be set:

MAPI_UNICODE
  
> The filter is in Unicode format. If the MAPI_UNICODE flag is not set, the filter is in ANSI format.

 **ulNumCharsAllowed**
  
> Maximum number of characters that the user can type into the text box.

 **ulPropTag**
  
> Property tag for a property of type PT_TSTRING. The **ulPropTag** member identifies the string property whose data is displayed and edited in the edit control.

## Remarks

A **DTBLEDIT** structure describes an edit control an area on a dialog box that contains alphanumeric information. Almost all dialog boxes have at least one edit control. Edit controls can be modifiable by a user or read-only.
  
Edit controls can also be single line or multiline. Multiline edit controls typically have a scroll bar associated with them.
