# Local Form Libraries

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Local form libraries are stored directly on a user's machine, usually in a file called FRMCACHE.DAT. 
  
Client applications can access forms in the local form library without accessing any network resources. Local form libraries are an exception to the rule that forms are stored in associated contents tables, since the local form library is simply a file on disk that is not part of any MAPI folder hierarchy.
