# Avoiding Using IStream::SetSize to Extend a Stream

**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016
  
When writing to streams, it is sometimes necessary to enlarge them because their initial size is no longer sufficient. Use the OLE method **IStream::Write** to accomplish this rather than **IStream::SetSize**. **IStream::Write** automatically extends the stream, making **IStream::SetSize** unnecessary. Calling **IStream::Write** without **IStream::SetSize** can be up to three times faster than making the **SetSize** call prior to **Write**.
