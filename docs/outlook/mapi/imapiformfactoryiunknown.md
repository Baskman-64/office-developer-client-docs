## Remarks

The **IMAPIFormFactory** interface is based on the [IClassFactory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms694364%28VS.85%29.aspx) interface, and objects that implement **IMAPIFormFactory** should also inherit from **IClassFactory**.
  
 **IMAPIFormFactory** is the interface that form viewers use to create new form objects when a form server supports more than one message class (that is, more than one type of form object).
