# PidTagOriginalAuthorSearchKey Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016

|Property |Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_ORIGINAL_AUTHOR_SEARCH_KEY  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0056  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BINARY  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Server  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property is one of the address properties for the author of a message. At first submission of the message, the client application should set this property to the value of the **PR_SENDER_SEARCH_KEY**[PidTagSenderSearchKey](pidtagsendersearchkey-canonical-property.md) property. It is never changed when the message is forwarded or replied to. 
  
The original author properties allow for preservation of information from outside the local messaging domain. When a message arrives from another messaging domain, such as from the Internet, these properties provide a way to ensure that original information is not lost.
