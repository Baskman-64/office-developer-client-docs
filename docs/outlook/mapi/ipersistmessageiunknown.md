## Remarks

All forms are required to implement the **IPersistMessage** interface. 
  
 **IPersistMessage** works similarly to the OLE [IPersistStorage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1c1a20fc-c101-4cbc-a7a6-30613aa387d7%28Office.15%29.aspx) interface. For more information, see the **IPersistStorage** methods.
