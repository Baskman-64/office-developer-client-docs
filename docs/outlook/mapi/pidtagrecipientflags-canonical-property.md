## Remarks

This property is not required. The following are the individual flags that can be set.
  
|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|S (recipSendable, 0x00000001)  <br/> |The recipient is a **Sendable** Attendee. It is set on all kinds of MAPI messages as well as in the **dispidApptUnsendableRecips** ([PidLidAppointmentUnsendableRecipients](pidlidappointmentunsendablerecipients-canonical-property.md)) property. |
|O (recipOrganizer, 0x0000002)  <br/> |The **RecipientRow** on which this flag is set represents the meeting Organizer. |
|ER (recipExceptionalResponse, 0x00000010)  <br/> |Indicates that the attendee gave a response for the exception on which this **RecipientRow** resides. This flag is only used in a **RecipientRow** of an exception embedded message object of the organizer's meeting object. |
|ED (recipExceptionalDeleted, 0x00000020)  <br/> |Indicates that although the **RecipientRow** exists, it should be treated as if the corresponding recipient does not. This flag is only used in a **RecipientRow** of an exception embedded message object of the organizer's meeting object. |
|X (reserved, 0x00000040)  <br/> |Must not be set. Outlook 2019 sets it anyway on the first message to a non-original attendee. |
|X (reserved, 0x00000080)  <br/> |Must not be set. |
|G (recipOriginal, 0x00000100)  <br/> |Indicates the recipient is an original attendee. This flag is only used in the **dispidApptUnsendableRecips** property. |
|X (reserved, 0x00000200)  <br/> |Reserved. Outlook 2019 sets this bit to indicate participants invited by the organizer (or a delegate acting on behalf the organizer). |
