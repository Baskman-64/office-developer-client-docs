# Table Positioning

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
The current position within a table is always indicated by a cursor. There is one cursor for each view of a table; its value is set by the table's implementer. When a client or service provider using the table makes a call to change the position of the table, the value of the cursor is reset. A table's position can be changed with:
  
- A bookmark.
    
- A fractional value.
    
- A filter.
