# PidTagContentCount Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Contains the number of messages in a folder, as computed by the message store.
  
|Property |Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_CONTENT_COUNT  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x3602  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_LONG  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Folder  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property computed by the message store is used for two different, though related, purposes. On a MapiFolder object, it contains the number of messages in a folder. In a heading row in categorized MAPI tables, it contains the number of non-associated messages in the category corresponding to that heading row.
  
The number contained in this property does not include associated entries in the folder. **PR_CONTENT_UNREAD** ([PidTagContentUnreadCount](pidtagcontentunreadcount-canonical-property.md)) contains the count of unread messages for the folder. A client application can read but not change this property and **PR_CONTENT_UNREAD**.
