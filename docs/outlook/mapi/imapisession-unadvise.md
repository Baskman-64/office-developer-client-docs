# IMAPISession::Unadvise

**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016
  
Cancels the sending of notifications previously set up with a call to the [IMAPISession::Advise](imapisession-advise.md) method.
  
```cpp
HRESULT Unadvise(
  ULONG_PTR ulConnection
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulConnection_
  
> [in] A connection number associated with an active notification registration. The value of _ulConnection_ must have been returned by a previous call to **IMAPISession::Advise**.

## Return value

S_OK
  
> The registration was successfully canceled.

## Remarks

The **IMAPISession::Unadvise** method cancels a registration for notification. **Unadvise** releases its pointer to the caller's advise sink, which it received in the **Advise** call used for registration.
  
Generally, **Unadvise** calls the advise sink's [IUnknown::Release](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682317%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) method during the **Unadvise** call. However, if another thread is in the process of calling the advise sink's [IMAPIAdviseSink::OnNotify](imapiadvisesink-onnotify.md) method, the **Release** call is delayed until the **OnNotify** method returns.
