**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
[IClassFactory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms694364%28VS.85%29.aspx) is the OLE interface that client applications use to create new form objects of your form server's message class. The following table lists the **IClassFactory** methods that are required. 
  
|**Method**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[CreateInstance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682215%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) <br/> |Creates a new form object. |
|[LockServer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682332%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) <br/> |Locks the form server in memory so that startup overhead can be avoided when multiple form objects are created. |
   
For all the information necessary to implement these methods, see the COM and ActiveX Object Services section in the Windows SDK.
