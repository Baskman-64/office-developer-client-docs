# IMAPIFormAdviseSink : IUnknown

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Enables form servers to receive notifications from form viewers. 
  
|Property |Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|Header file:  <br/> |Mapiform.h  <br/> |
|Exposed by:  <br/> |Form advise sink objects  <br/> |
|Implemented by:  <br/> |Form servers  <br/> |
|Called by:  <br/> |Form viewers  <br/> |
|Interface identifier:  <br/> |IID_IMAPIFormAdviseSink  <br/> |
|Pointer type:  <br/> |LPMAPIFORMADVISESINK  <br/> |
   
## Vtable order

|Member |Description |
|:-----|:-----|
|[OnChange](imapiformadvisesink-onchange.md) <br/> |Indicates that a change has occurred in the status of the form viewer. |
|[OnActivateNext](imapiformadvisesink-onactivatenext.md) <br/> |Indicates whether the form can handle the message class of the next message to display. |
   
## Remarks

Form servers use a form advise sink object to implement **IMAPIFormAdviseSink** instead of including it with their form object. Therefore, form viewers should expect a failed call to a form's [IUnknown::QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682521%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) method to obtain a pointer to this interface. 
  
Form servers call a viewer's [IMAPIViewContext::SetAdviseSink](imapiviewcontext-setadvisesink.md) method to register for notifications. A pointer to their **IMAPIFormAdviseSink** implementation is included as a parameter.
