# MAPI Session Handling

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Before you can communicate with service providers and an underlying messaging system, you must establish a session. A MAPI session is a link from a client to other MAPI components. As the result of successfully starting a session, MAPI returns to clients a pointer to a session object â€” an object that implements the **IMAPISession** interface. For more information, see [IMAPISession : IUnknown](imapisessioniunknown.md). You can use the methods of the **IMAPISession** interface to access the objects of address book and message store providers, access several tables, display forms, set transport provider properties, and perform profile and message service administration.
