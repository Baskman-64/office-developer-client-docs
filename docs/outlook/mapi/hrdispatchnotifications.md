|Property |Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|Header file:  <br/> |Mapiutil.h  <br/> |
|Implemented by:  <br/> |MAPI  <br/> |

);
```

## Parameters

 _ulFlags_

## Return value

S_OK

MAPI_E_NOT_INITIALIZED

## Remarks

The **HrDispatchNotifications** function causes MAPI to dispatch all notifications that are currently queued in the MAPI notification engine without waiting for a message dispatch. This can have a beneficial effect on memory utilization. For more information, see [Forcing a Notification](forcing-a-notification.md). 
  
## Notes to callers

Some applications wait for a notification message in a timeout loop using the Windows [PeekMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms644943.aspx) and [DispatchMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms644934.aspx) functions. On all but the fastest platforms, such applications might experience poor performance or even blockage of notifications. Using **HrDispatchNotifications** not only reduces code but improves performance.
