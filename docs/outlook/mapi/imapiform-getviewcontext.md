# IMAPIForm::GetViewContext

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Returns the current view context for the form. 
  
```cpp
HRESULT GetViewContext(
  LPMAPIVIEWCONTEXT FAR * ppViewContext
);
```

## Parameters

 _ppViewContext_
  
> [out] A pointer to a pointer to the form's view context.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The form's current view context was successfully returned. 
    
S_FALSE 
  
> There is no view context for the form.
    
## Remarks

Form viewers call **GetViewContext** to obtain a pointer to the view context established in a previous call to [IMAPIForm::SetViewContext](imapiform-setviewcontext.md). If no prior call has been made to **SetViewContext**, **GetViewContext** sets  _ppViewContext_ to NULL. 
  
## Notes to implementers

Copy your form's view context pointer into the pointer passed in by the calling form viewer in the _ppViewContext_ parameter. If the form does not have a view context, set  _ppViewContext_ to NULL.
