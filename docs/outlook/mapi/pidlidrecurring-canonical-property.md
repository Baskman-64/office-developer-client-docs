## Remarks

This property is TRUE if the appointment is a recurring appointment, and is FALSE if it is not recurring.
  
This property specifies whether or not the object represents a recurring series. A value of TRUE indicates that the object represents a recurring series. A value of FALSE, or the absence of this property, indicates that the object represents either a single instance or an exception (including an orphan instance). Note the difference between this property and the **LID_IS_RECURRING** ([PidLidIsRecurring](pidlidisrecurring-canonical-property.md)) property.
