# MAPI Forms

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
After reading this overview of the MAPI form architecture, you will have an understanding of what MAPI forms are and how they interact with other components of the MAPI subsystem. The purpose of this section is to give you the conceptual knowledge you need to implement your own MAPI form servers.
  
Before reading this section, you should familiarize yourself with the material in the [MAPI Forms Overview](mapi-forms-overview.md) topic. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Because the MAPI form architecture is based on the Component Object Model (COM), developing form server applications requires knowledge of COM programming. For more information about COM, see the COM and ActiveX Object Services section in the Windows SDK.
