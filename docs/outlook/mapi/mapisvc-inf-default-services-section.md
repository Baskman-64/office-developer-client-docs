# MapiSvc.inf [Default Services] Section

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
The **[Default Services]** section lists all of the message services that are selected as default message services. These default message services are a subset of the message services listed in the **[Services]** section. When a profile configuration program creates a default profile, the message services in this section are automatically included. 
  
The entries use the same format as entries in the **[Services]** section, as shown following: 
  
 **[Default Services]**
  
 _message-service section name_ =  _message service name_
  
The following entries would be included in the **[Default Services]** section for the mapisvc.inf shown in the earlier illustration: 
  
```cpp
[Default Services]
AB=Default Address Book
MsgService=My Own Service

```
