# FreePadrlist

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Destroys an [ADRLIST](adrlist.md) structure and frees associated memory, including memory allocated for all member arrays and structures. 
  
|Property |Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|Header file:  <br/> |Mapiutil.h  <br/> |
|Implemented by:  <br/> |MAPI  <br/> |
|Called by:  <br/> |Client applications and service providers  <br/> |
   
```cpp
void FreePadrlist(
  LPADRLIST padrlist
);
```

## Parameters

 _padrlist_
  
> [in] Pointer to the **ADRLIST** structure to be destroyed. 
    
## Return value

None.
  
## Notes to callers

As part of its implementation of **FreePadrlist**, MAPI calls the [MAPIFreeBuffer](mapifreebuffer.md) function to free every entry in the **ADRLIST** structure before freeing the complete structure. Therefore all such entries must have followed the allocation rules for the [ADRLIST](adrlist.md) structure, using an individual [MAPIAllocateBuffer](mapiallocatebuffer.md) call for each member array and structure. 
  
For more information about allocating memory for **ADRLIST** and **SRowSet** structures, see [Managing Memory for ADRLIST and SRowSet Structures](managing-memory-for-adrlist-and-srowset-structures.md).
