# ISocialPerson::GetActivities

This method has been deprecated in Outlook Social Connector 2013.
  
```cpp
HRESULT _stdcall GetActivities([in] DATE startTime, [out, retval] BSTR* activities);
```

## Remarks

Starting in Outlook Social Connector 2013, the OSC supports only on-demand synchronization of activities and not cached or hybrid synchronization of activities. The OSC ignores the **cacheActivities** setting in the capabilities XML and does not call this method. To support dynamic activities lookup, implement the [ISocialSession2::GetActivitiesEx](isocialsession2-getactivitiesex.md) method. Set **cacheActivities** as **false**, **getActivities** and **dynamicActivitiesLookupEx** as **true**, which will prompt the OSC to call **ISocialSession2::GetActivitiesEx** instead. 
  
For more information about how the OSC gets friends' activities, see [Synchronizing Friends and Activities](synchronizing-friends-and-activities.md).
