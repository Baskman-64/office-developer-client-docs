# SharePoint Workflow Support in InfoPath Forms

Document workflow is a feature of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 that enables you to define a workflow and use it in a document library. Built-in workflow scenarios, such as routing a document for approval or collecting feedback about a document are common workflow templates that can be customized to fit your particular needs. Any Office document can have a workflow associated with it, but Microsoft InfoPath form templates can also be designed in a way that enables workflow information to be incorporated in the InfoPath form template. 
  
For information about how to design InfoPath forms for workflow, see [InfoPath Forms for Workflows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f2b0423e-22d7-485f-a723-19fa68759ef3%28Office.15%29.aspx) in the [SharePoint Server 2010 General Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b3bf6083-997f-48c3-9ea3-e351439699ba%28Office.15%29.aspx) documentation.
