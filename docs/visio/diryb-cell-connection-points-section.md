To get a reference to the DirY / B cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use:
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Cell name:**  <br/> |Connections.DirY[*i*]           <br/>where *i* = <1>, 2, 3... |

To get a reference to the DirY / B cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments:
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionConnectionPts** <br/> |
|**Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowConnectionPts** + *i*           <br/>where *i* = 0, 1, 2... |
|**Cell index:**  <br/> |**visCnnctDirY** (non-extended rows)          <br/>**visCnnctB** (extended rows)  <br/> |

For information about non-extended and extended rows, see Connection Points row.
