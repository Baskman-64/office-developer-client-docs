# Label Cell (Shape Data Section)

Specifies the label that appears to users in the **Shape Data** window. A label consists of alphanumeric characters, including the underscore (_) character. 
  
## Remarks

The application automatically encloses the Label string in quotation marks in the cell, but the quotation marks are not displayed in the **Shape Data** window. 
  
If no label text is found, Visio displays the row name (Prop.Row) in the **Shape Data** window. 
  
To get a reference to the Label cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Cell name:**  <br/> |Prop. *Name*  .Label where Prop.  *Name*  is the row name  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the Label cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionProp** <br/> |
|**Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowProp** +  *i*  where  *i*  = 0, 1, 2... |
|**Cell index:**  <br/> |**visCustPropsLabel** <br/> |
