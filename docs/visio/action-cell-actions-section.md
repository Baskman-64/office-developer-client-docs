Contains the formula to be executed when a user chooses a command on a shortcut or action tag menu.
  
> [!NOTE]
> In previous versions of Microsoft Visio, action tags are called smart tags.

| **Cell name:**  <br/> | Actions.  *name*  .Action           where Actions. *name*  is the name of the actions row  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to thethe Action cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionAction** <br/> |
| **Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowAction** +  *i*            where  *i*  = 0, 1, 2... |
| **Cell index:**  <br/> |**visActionAction** <br/> |
