# Reviewer Section

Contains identifying information about each document reviewer.
  
## Remarks

The reviewer section contains one row for each reviewer who has added markup to the document, even if all of a particular reviewer's markup is deleted. 
  
The reviewer section is contained in the ShapeSheet of a document. To view a document's ShapeSheet, on the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, in the **Show/Hide** group, select **Drawing Explorer**, right-click the document name, and then click **Show ShapeSheet**. 
  
For more information about comments that are added to a document as a part of markup, see the **Annotation** section.
