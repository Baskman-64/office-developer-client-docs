# SETATREFEXPR Function

Stores a value that is set through an action in the user interface (UI) or Automation.
  
## Syntax

SETATREFEXPR ([ ***expr_opt* * ])
  
### Parameters

|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| *expr_opt* <br/> |Optional  <br/> |**Varies** <br/> |An expression that is replaced by the value or expression being assigned to the referenced cell in the SETATREF function. If not indicated, its initial value is 0 (zero). |

## Remarks

The value of a SETATREFEXPR expression can also be set from a SETATREF function in another cell that references the cell containing the SETATREFEXPR expression.
  
You are not limited to using the SETATREFEXPR function as a parameter to the SETATREF function.
  
## Example 1

The following example uses the SETATREFEXPR function to ensure that a shape is as wide as its text.
  
Width =MAX(TEXTWIDTH(TheText),SETATREFEXPR())
  
## Example 2

The following example shows how you can use the SETATREFEXPR function to cause your shapes to snap to a custom grid. The SETATREFEXPR formulas are placed in the PinX and PinY cells, causing the shape's pin to snap to the grid defined in User.GridX and User.GridY.
  
User.GridX =2 in
  
User.GridY =2 in
  
PinX =INT(SETATREFEXPR()/User.GridX + .5)\*User.GridX
  
PinY =INT(SETATREFEXPR()/User.GridY + .5)\*User.GridY
  
## Example 3

For an example using the SETATREFEXPR function with the SETATREF function, see the [SETATREF](setatref-function.md) function.
