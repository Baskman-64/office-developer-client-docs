# IsDropSource Cell (Miscellaneous Section)

Determines whether the shape can be added to a group by dropping it onto the group.
  
|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|TRUE  <br/> |Can add the shape to a group by dropping it onto the group. |
|FALSE  <br/> |Cannot add the shape to a group. |
   
## Remarks

You can also set this value by selecting the shape, clicking **Behavior** on the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, and then selecting the **Add shape to groups on drop** check box. 
  
In addition to enabling this behavior for a shape, you must also enable a group to accept shapes that are dragged into it. To do so, select the group, click **Behavior** on the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, and then select the **Accept dropped shapes** check box. This value is stored in the IsDropTarget cell in the Group Properties section.
