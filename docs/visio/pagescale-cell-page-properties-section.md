# PageScale Cell (Page Properties Section)

Determines the value of the page unit in the current drawing scale. The drawing scale for the page is the ratio of the page unit shown in the PageScale cell to the drawing unit shown in the DrawingScale cell.
  
## Remarks

You can also set the value of the PageScale cell on the **Drawing Scale** tab in the **Page Setup** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, click the **Page Setup** arrow). The value of the cell is the first of the two numbers in the **Pre-defined scale** box or **Custom scale** box, depending on the drawing scale setting selected under **Drawing scale**. For example, if you select an architectural scale for your drawing, the drawing scale for the page is 3/32" = 1'0". The value in the PageScale cell is 0.0938 in. (or 3/32") and the value in the DrawingScale cell is 1 ft.
  
To get a reference to the PageScale cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Cell name:**  <br/> |PageScale  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the PageScale cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
|**Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowPage** <br/> |
|**Cell index:**  <br/> |**visPageScale** <br/> |
