# DistanceFromGround Cell (3-D Rotation Properties)

Determines the distance the object is raised from the ground in points when rotated in 3-D.
  
## Remarks

To get a reference to the **DistanceFromGround** cell by name from another formula, by value of the **N** attribute of a **Cell** element, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Cell name:**  <br/> |DistanceFromGround  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the **DistanceFromGround** cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
|**Row index:**  <br/> |**visRow3DRotationProperties** <br/> |
|**Cell index:**  <br/> |**visDistanceFromGround** <br/> |
