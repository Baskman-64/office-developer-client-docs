## Remarks

You can set the value of many of the cells in this section in the ShapeSheet window, or on the **Behavior** tab in the **Behavior** dialog box (click **Behavior** in the **Shape Design** group on the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab). in the drawing window. You can set other group properties using cells in the Group Properties section. 
  
In Visio version 5.0 products, this section included **ObjInteract** and **ObjBehavior** cells. The behavior in the **ObjInteract** cell is now mapped to the following cells in the Shape Layout section: **ShapeFixedCode**, **ShapePermeableX**, **ShapePermeableY**, and **ShapePermeablePlace**. The behavior in the ObjBehavior cell is now mapped to the **ConFixedCode** and **ShapeRouteStyle** cells. 
  
In Visio version 5.0 Japanese products, this section included a **VerticalText** cell. In Visio version 2000 products and later, the value of this cell is stored in the **TextDirection** cell in the **Text Block Format** section.
