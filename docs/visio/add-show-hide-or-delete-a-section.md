# Add, Show, Hide, or Delete a Section

You can add, show, hide, and delete sections in the ShapeSheet.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you want to add your own custom section to the ShapeSheet, use the [User-defined Cells](user-defined-cells-section.md) or [Scratch](scratch-section.md) sections to define your ShapeSheet logic.
  
### To add a section

1. Click in the ShapeSheet window to make it active.

2. Do one of the following:

- Under **ShapeSheet Tools** on the **Design** tab, in the **Sections** group, click **Insert**.

- Or right-click in the ShapeSheet window, and then click **Insert Section** on the shortcut menu.

3. Select the check box for the section you want to add, and then click **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the new section in the ShapeSheet window, make sure the section is set to appear. In the **View** group on the **ShapeSheet Tools** tab, click **Sections**, and then select the check boxes for the sections you want to appear.
  
### To show or hide sections

- Select any cell in the section you want to delete, and then in the **Sections** group on the **ShapeSheet Tools** tab, click **Delete**.

- You can also right-click a cell, and then click **Delete Section** on the shortcut menu.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Certain sections cannot be deleted. For example, you cannot delete the **Shape Transform** section because it specifies a shape's position. If you cannot delete a section, **Delete Section** is unavailable.

2. Point to the section title.
