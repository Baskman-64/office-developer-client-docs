# Ruler &amp; Grid Section

Shows the current settings of the page's rulers and grid.
  
## Remarks

This section is a page property that can be viewed only in the ShapeSheet window for a page. The cells it contains correspond to the settings in the **Ruler &amp; Grid** dialog box (on the **View** tab, in the **Show/Hide** group, click the dialog box launcher).
