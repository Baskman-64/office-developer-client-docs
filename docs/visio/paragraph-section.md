# Paragraph Section

Shows the paragraph formatting attributes for the shape's text, such as indents, line spacing, bullets, and horizontal alignment of paragraphs.
  
## Remarks

Paragraph formats can be set by making an entry in a **Paragraph** section cell by applying a text style, or by entering values in the **Text** dialog box (on the **Home** tab, click the dialog box launcher in the **Font** group). 
  
The **Paragraph** section does not include cells for tab settings. To set tabs for a shape's text, use the **Text** dialog box.
