# Fill Format Section

Shows the current fill formatting attributes for the shape and the shape's drop shadow, including pattern, foreground color, and background color. 
  
## Remarks

You can set fill formats in the **Format Shape** pane (on the **Home** tab, in the **Shape Styles** group, click **Fill**, and then click **Fill Options**), by applying a fill style, or by making an entry in a cell in the **Fill Format** section.
