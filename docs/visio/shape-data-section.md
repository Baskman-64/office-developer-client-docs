# Shape Data Section

Contains one row for each item of shape data and cells for associating data with a shape.
  
## Remarks

Shape Data can be defined by using the **Shape Data** window or the cells in the Shape Data section. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> In previous versions of Visio, the **Shape Data** section was called **Custom Properties**. 
  
- In the ShapeSheet window, you can define shape data in the **Shape Data** section. Right-click in the ShapeSheet window and click **Insert Section**, and then select the **Shape Data** check box. You can add as many Prop.  *name*  rows as you need, assign meaningful names to the rows, and set cell values. 
    
- In the drawing window, you can define shape data in the **Shape Data** window. On the **View** tab, in the **Show/Hide** group, click **Task Panes**, and then click **Shape Data**. To access the **Define Shape Data** dialog box, right-click the **Shape Data** window, and then click **Define Shape Data**.
