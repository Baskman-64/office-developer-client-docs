# ShdwOffsetX Cell (Page Properties Section)

Determines the distance in page units that a shape's drop shadow is offset horizontally from the shape.
  
## Remarks

This value is set in the **Page Setup** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, click the **Page Setup** arrow). This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the shadow offset remains the same.
