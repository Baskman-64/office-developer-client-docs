# Shape Layout Section

Contains cells that control shape placement and connector routing settings.
  
## Remarks

You can also set the values of the shape-specific cells in this section by using the **Placement** tab in the **Behavior** dialog box (on the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, in the **Shape Design** group, click **Behavior**). You can set the values of the connector-specific cells in this section using the **Connector** tab in the **Behavior** dialog box. (To see the **Connector** tab, select the connector in the drawing window, and then display the **Behavior** dialog box.) 
  
You can use values in the **Shape Layout** section to override default values contained in the **Page Layout** section.
