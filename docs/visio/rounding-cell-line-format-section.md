# Rounding Cell (Line Format Section)

Indicates the radius of the rounding arc applied where two contiguous segments of a path meet. For example, rounding can be used to give a rectangle rounded corners. To set rounding, enter a value with units of measure (a number-unit pair).
  
## Remarks

You can also set this value in the **Line** dialog box (on the **Home** tab, in the **Shape** group, click **Line**, point to **Weight**, and then click **More Lines**).
  
To get a reference to the Rounding cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Cell name:**  <br/> |Rounding  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the Rounding cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
|**Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowLine** <br/> |
|**Cell index:**  <br/> |**visLineRounding** <br/> |
