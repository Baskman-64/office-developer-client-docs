# Tabs Section

Contains cells for shapes or styles that control tab stop position and alignment.
  
## Remarks

You can also set these values by using the **Tabs** tab in the **Text** dialog box (click dialog box launcher in the **Font** group on the **Home** tab) or by using the **Text Ruler**. To display the **Text Ruler**, right-click the text while in text-editing mode, and then click **Text Ruler** on the shortcut menu. 
  
You can set tab stops for specific characters by selecting the text, and then setting the tab stop. When you set tab stops for specific characters, a new row is added in the ShapeSheet window. The name of the row represents the number of characters the tab stop contains.
