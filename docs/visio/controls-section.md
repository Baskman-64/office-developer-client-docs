# Controls Section

Contains a row and cells for each control handle defined for the shape.
  
## Remarks

You can define control handles in the **Controls** section in the ShapeSheet window. If your shape has no **Controls** section, you can insert one in the ShapeSheet window. Right-click in the ShapeSheet window, click **Insert Section**, and then select the **Controls** check box. To add control handles to an existing **Controls** section, right-click a row and click **Insert Row** on the shortcut menu.
