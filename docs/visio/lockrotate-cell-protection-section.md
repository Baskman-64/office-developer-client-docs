# LockRotate Cell (Protection Section)

Locks 2-D shapes against being rotated with the rotation handle or the **Rotate Left 90째** or **Rotate Right 90째** command. 
  
|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| TRUE  <br/> | Shape cannot be rotated. |
| FALSE  <br/> | Shape can be rotated (the default). |
   
## Remarks

The LockRotate cell does not prevent a 1-D shape from being rotated when an endpoint is dragged. To lock a 1-D shape against rotation, set the LockWidth cell to a non-zero value (TRUE).
  
To get a reference to the LockRotate cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Cell name:**  <br/> | LockRotate  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the LockRotate cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
| **Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowLock** <br/> |
| **Cell index:**  <br/> |**visLockRotate** <br/> |
