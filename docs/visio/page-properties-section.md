# Page Properties Section

Contains cells that control page attributes, such as the page width, height, and scale.
  
## Remarks

You can set the values of page properties by making an entry in the **Page Properties** section cell, or by using the **Page Setup** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, click the dialog box launcher in the **Page Setup** group).
