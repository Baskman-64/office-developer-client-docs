# AvenueSizeY Cell (Page Layout Section)

Determines the amount of vertical space between shapes on the drawing page when you lay out shapes by using the **Configure Layout** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, in the **Layout** group, click **Re-Layout** Page, and then click **More Layout Options**).
  
## Remarks

You can also set this value in the **Layout and Routing Spacing** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, click the arrow in the **Page Setup** group, click the **Layout and Routing** tab, and then click **Spacing**).
  
The dynamic grid uses the setting in the AvenueSizeY cell when only one shape is available for calculating vertical spacing. To use the dynamic grid, on the **View** tab, in the **Visual Aids** group, select **Dynamic Grid**.
  
To get a reference to the AvenueSizeY cell by name from another formula, or from a program by using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Cell name:**  <br/> | AvenueSizeY  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the AvenueSizeY cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
| **Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowPageLayout** <br/> |
| **Cell index:**  <br/> |**visPLOAvenueSizeY** <br/> |
