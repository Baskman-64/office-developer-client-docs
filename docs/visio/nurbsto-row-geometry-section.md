# NURBSTo Row (Geometry Section)

Contains the  *x*  - and  *y*  -coordinates, position of the second to last knot, position of the last weight, position of the first knot, position of the first weight, and the formula for a nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS). 
  
A NURBSTo row contains the following cells.
  
|**Cell**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[X](x-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The *x*  -coordinate of the last control point of a NURBS. |
|[Y](y-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The *y*  -coordinate of the last control point of a NURBS. |
|[A](a-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The second to the last knot of the NURBS. |
|[B](b-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The last weight of the NURBS. |
|[C](c-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The first knot of the NURBS. |
|[D](d-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The first weight of the NURBS. |
|[E](e-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |A NURBS formula. |
   
## Remarks

NURBS is a common way to represent a curve mathematically. You can create a NURBS with the **Freeform** tool.
