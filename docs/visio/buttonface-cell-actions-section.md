# ButtonFace Cell (Actions Section)

Identifies the icon that appears next to an item on a shortcut or action tag menu.
  
> [!NOTE]
> In previous versions of Microsoft Visio, action tags are called smart tags. 
  
## Remarks

The string contained in the ButtonFace cell represents the ID of a Microsoft Office button face image. A value of zero (0) or blank means no icon appears. 
  
The IDs that can be used in the ButtonFace cell are the same as the IDs used with the **FaceID** property of a **CommandBarButton** object. For more details about these IDs, search for "working with command bar button images" on MSDN. 
  
To get a reference to the ButtonFace cell by name from another formula, or from a program by using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Cell name:**  <br/> |**Actions**.  *name*  . **ButtonFace**         where **Actions**.  *name*  is the name of the actions row  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the ButtonFace cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionAction** <br/> |
|**Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowAction** +  *i*           where **i** = 0, 1, 2... |
|**Cell index:**  <br/> |**visActionButtonFace** <br/> |
