# Line Gradient Section

Shows the color values for the line gradient applied to the shape. 
  
## Remarks

Each [Gradient Stop Row (Line Gradient Section)](gradient-stop-row-line-gradient-section.md) row in the section represents a gradient stop in the line. This section can be empty. 
  
Only the first 10 rows contained in the section are used by the gradient settings. All **Gradient Stop** rows beyond 10 are ignored. 
  
You can set the line gradient properties in the **Line** section of the **Format Shape** pane (on the **Home** tab, in the **Shape Styles** group, click **Line**, and then click **Line Options**). 
  
You can enable or disable a gradient line color for the shape by changing the value of the [LineGradientEnabled Cell (Gradient Properties Section)](linegradientenabled-cell-gradient-properties-section.md) cell.
