# Action Tag Section

Contains a row for each action tag defined for a shape or page.
  
> [!NOTE]
> In previous versions of Microsoft Visio, action tags are called smart tags. 
  
## Remarks

The **Action Tag** section controls the appearance and position of action tags in the drawing. Using the **TagName** cell, you can associate each action tag with a row or rows in the Actions section, where menu items that appear on an action tag menu are defined. 
  
 A single shape or page can contain multiple action tags. 
  
If an action tag has no matching actions, the action tag button appears and disappears as defined, but its menu is blank.
  
You can only insert an **Action Tag** section in the ShapeSheet window (right-click in the ShapeSheet window, click **Insert Section**, and then select the **Action tags** check box). To add an action tag to an existing **Action Tag** section, right-click a row, and then click **Insert Row** on the shortcut menu.
