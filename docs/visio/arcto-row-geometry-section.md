# ArcTo Row (Geometry Section)

Contains the  *x*  - and  *y*  -coordinates and bow of a circular arc. 
  
An ArcTo row contains the following cells.
  
|**Cell**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[X](x-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The *x*  -coordinate of the ending vertex of an arc. |
|[Y](y-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The *y*  -coordinate of the ending vertex of an arc. |
|[A](a-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The distance from the arc's midpoint to the midpoint of its chord. |
   
## Remarks

Arcs drawn in Visio are elliptical arcs, even if they are based on a circle. By default, drawn arcs are represented by an EllipticalArcTo row in a ShapeSheet window. To show an ArcTo row in a ShapeSheet window, you must draw an arc, and then change the EllipticalArcTo row type to an ArcTo row type; in effect you are changing an elliptical arc to a circular arc.
  
To change a row type, right-click a row, and then click **Change Row Type** on the shortcut menu.
