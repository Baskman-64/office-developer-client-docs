# SpAfter Cell (Paragraph Section)

Determines the amount of space inserted after each paragraph in the shape's text block, in addition to any space from the SpLine cell and, if it is the last paragraph in a text block, the BottomMargin cell.
  
## Remarks

This value is independent of the scale of the drawing. If the drawing is scaled, the Space After setting remains the same.
