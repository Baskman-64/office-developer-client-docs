# Type a New Formula for a Cell

1. Select the cell.
    
    The cell's formula appears in the cell and in the formula bar.
    
2. Type the new formula.
    
    The formula you type replaces the cell's previous formula.
    
    If you type a number but don't supply units of measure, Microsoft Visio uses the units from the cell's previous value if there was one. Otherwise, if the cell requires units, Visio uses the default units for the cell.
    
3. To accept the formula, press ENTER.
    
    If the number or formula contains an error, Visio displays a message and then highlights the error in the formula bar or cell. Correct the error, and press ENTER to accept the correction.
