# Show an Object in the ShapeSheet Window

Microsoft Visio objects are stored internally as a set of formulas. You can view a Visio object in the ShapeSheet window to see and edit the underlying formulas that determine its appearance and behavior.
  
For details on how to show a specific object in the ShapeSheet window, click an element in the following list.
  
## Show a shape, group, guide, guide point, or foreign object

1. Select the object.
    
2. On the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, click **Show ShapeSheet**.
    
## Show a master

You can access the ShapeSheet window and edit formulas only for masters on a custom or document stencil. Beginning with Microsoft Office Visio 2003, you cannot edit masters on stencils that ship with the Visio product.
  
1. In the **Shapes** window, click **More Shapes**, and then click **Open Stencil**.
    
2. Locate and select the stencil that contains the master, click the arrow next to the **Open** button, select an opening option from the drop-down list, and then click **Open**. 
    
    If the stencil is already open, right-click the stencil title bar, and then click **Edit Stencil** on the shortcut menu. 
    
3. Right-click the master on the stencil, click **Edit Master** on the shortcut menu, and then click **Edit Master Shape**.
    
4. In the master editing window, right-click the master and then click **Show ShapeSheet**.
    
## Show a page

1. Make sure nothing on the page is selected.
    
2. Right-click the page and then click **Show ShapeSheet**.
    
## Show a document

1. On the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, in the **Show/Hide** group, select **Drawing Explorer Window**.
    
2. In the **Drawing Explorer**, right-click the document, and then click **Show ShapeSheet** on the shortcut menu. 
    
## Show a style

1. On the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, in the **Show/Hide** group, select **Drawing Explorer Window**.
    
2. In the **Drawing Explorer**, expand the **Styles** folder. 
    
3. Right-click the style, and then click **Show ShapeSheet** on the shortcut menu.
