# Protection Section

Shows the current lock settings set with the **Protection** command ( [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab) plus a few additional locks that can be set only in a ShapeSheet window. 
  
## Remarks

Locking helps prevent inadvertent changes to the shape but does not prevent values from being reset in other circumstances. It also does not protect against changes made in the ShapeSheet window.
  
To protect a formula from being changed, use the **GUARD** function.
