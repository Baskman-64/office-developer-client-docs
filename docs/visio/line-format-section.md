# Line Format Section

Contains cells that control line attributes for a shape, such as pattern, weight, and color. They determine whether the line ends are formatted (for example, with an arrowhead), the size of line end formats, radius of the rounding circle applied to the line, and line cap style (round or square).
  
## Remarks

You can set line formats by using the **Format Shape** pane (on the **Home** tab, in the **Shape Styles** group, click **Line**, click **Line Options**), by applying a line style, or by entering a formula in a Line Format cell.
