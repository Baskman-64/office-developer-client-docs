# Layer Membership Section

Contains one row that lists each layer to which the shape is assigned.
  
## Remarks

The layer assignment is shown as an index to the list of layers on the page. The layer index corresponds to the order of the layers in the **Layer Properties** dialog box (on the **Home** tab, in the **Editing** group, click **Layers**, and then click **Layer Properties**). The first name in the dialog box is layer 0, the second is layer 1, and so forth.
  
If a shape is assigned to more than one layer, each layer index appears in the Layer Membership cell separated by a semicolon.
  
To refer to the value of the Layer Membership cell in a formula, use the name **LayerMember**.
