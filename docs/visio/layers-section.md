# Layers Section

Shows all layers defined for the page and the properties set for each layer. 
  
## Remarks

This section is a page property that can be viewed only in the ShapeSheet window for a page. Its cells correspond to the options in the **Layer Properties** dialog box (on the **Home** tab, in the **Editing** group, click **Layers**, and then click **Layer Properties**).
