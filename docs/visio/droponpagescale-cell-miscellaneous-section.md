# DropOnPageScale Cell (Miscellaneous Section)

Contains the percentage by which a shape is scaled when dropped on the drawing page.
  
## Remarks

In the following two cases, Visio scales shapes so that they appear appropriately on the drawing page:
  
- When unmeasured shapes are dropped onto scaled drawings.
    
- When measured shapes are dropped onto unscaled drawings.
    
The percentage in the DropOnPageScale cell indicates the factor by which Visio scaled the shape, either up (\>100) or down (\<100). You can use this number as a factor when calculating hard-coded values. 
  
This value is 100% for measured shapes on scaled drawings or unmeasured shapes on unscaled drawings. 
  
To get a reference to the DropOnPageScale cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Cell name:**  <br/> | DropOnPageScale  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the DropOnPageScale cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
| **Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowMisc** <br/> |
| **Cell index:**  <br/> |**visObjDropOnPageScale** <br/> |
