# BegTrigger Cell (Glue Info Section)

Contains a trigger formula generated by the application that determines whether to move the begin point of a 1-D shape to maintain its connection to another shape.
  
## Remarks

When you glue a 1-D shape to another shape using dynamic glue, the application generates a formula that refers to the EventXFMod cell of the other shape. When that shape is changed, Visio recalculates any formula that refers to its EventXFMod cell, including the formula in the BegTrigger cell. Other formulas for the 1-D shape refer to the BegTrigger cell and move the begin point of the 1-D shape or alter the shape as needed.
  
To get a reference to the BegTrigger cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Cell name:**  <br/> | BegTrigger  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the BegTrigger cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
||Value |
|:-----|:-----|
| **Section index:**  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
| **Row index:**  <br/> |**visRowGroup** <br/> |
| **Cell index:**  <br/> |**visBegTrigger** <br/> |
