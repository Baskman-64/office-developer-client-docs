# Annotation Section

Contains information about comments inserted into a document page. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> This section is used for tracking comments only when opening a .vsd file in Microsoft Visio 2013 or when saving a .vsdx file in the .vsd file format. It is not used for tracking comments in new .vsdx documents in Visio 2013. 
  
## Remarks

The **Annotation** section of a page's ShapeSheet contains one row for each comment added to a page in the drawing, whether it is an original drawing page or a markup overlay page (a page containing markup that has been added to the drawing by a reviewer). Information about markup that has been added using ink or other shapes, rather than comments, is not included in the **Annotation** section. 
  
To view the ShapeSheet for a page, make sure nothing is selected on the page, right-click the page, and click **Show ShapeSheet**.
  
For information about particular reviewers, see the **Reviewer** section in the document's ShapeSheet.
