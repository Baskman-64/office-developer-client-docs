# SplineStart Row (Geometry Section)

Contains  *x*  - and  *y*  -coordinates for a spline's second control point, its second knot, its first knot, the last knot, and the degree of the spline. 
  
A SplineStart row contains the following cells.
  
|**Cell**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[X](x-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The *x*  -coordinate of a spline's second control point. |
|[Y](y-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The *y*  -coordinate of a spline's second control point. |
|[A](a-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The second knot of the spline. |
|[B](b-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The first knot of a spline. |
|[C](c-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The last knot of a spline. |
|[D](d-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |The degree of a spline (an integer from 1 to 25). |
   
## Remarks

Visio displays the definition of a spline in a Geometry section that contains a SplineStart row followed by one or more SplineKnot rows. The SplineStart row must be preceded by another kind of row, such as a MoveTo row, to indicate the first control point of the spline. The preceding row can be a LineTo, ArcTo, NURBSTo, PolylineTo, or EllipticalArcTo row if the spline follows a segment of that type.
