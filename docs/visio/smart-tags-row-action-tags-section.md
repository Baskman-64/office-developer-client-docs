 You can add as many SmartTags.  *name*  rows as you need, assign meaningful names to the rows, and set cell values. To add an action tag to an existing Smart Tags section, right-click a row and click **Insert Row** on the shortcut menu.
  
You can reference these cells by their row name, which appears in a ShapeSheet window in red text. To assign meaningful names to Smart Tags. *name* rows, click the row, and then type a name such as *Size*, for example, to create the row name Smart Tags.Size. You can then reference the Description cell using Smart Tags.Size.Description.
  
The row name you enter must be unique within the section.
