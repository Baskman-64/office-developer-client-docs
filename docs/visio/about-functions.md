# About Functions

A function performs a single well-defined task. Most functions take a number of arguments as input. Although the type and number of arguments depend on the function, all functions have the same general syntax:
  
 **FUNCTION(** _argument1_, _argument2_, â€¦ _argumentN_ [, _argumentA_ | _argument_ **])**
  
|**Syntax element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| ( )  <br/> | If a function takes no arguments, it must be followed by an empty set of parentheses ( ). |
| ,  <br/> | Arguments are separated by a comma. |
| ... | Used for notation only; do not include in a function. |
| [ ]  <br/> | Optional argument. Used for notation only; do not include in a function. |
| \|  <br/> | A choice; you can include  _argumentA_ or  _argument_. Used for notation only; do not include in a function. |

Many functions that you can use in formulas resemble those you have seen in spreadsheet programs: mathematical, such as SUM or SQRT; trigonometric, such as SIN or COS; or logical, such as IF or NOT. Many other functions are unique to Microsoft Office Visio, such as GUARD, GRAVITY, and RUNADDON.
  
For more information on specific functions, see this ShapeSheet Reference.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Certain functions appear in formulas generated by Visio, but are not shown in the **Edit Formula** dialog box or described in this reference because they are reserved for internal use and should not be used in other formulas. Following are examples: ELLIPSE_THETA, _ELLIPSE_ECC,_UCON_C1, and _SHAPEMIN.
