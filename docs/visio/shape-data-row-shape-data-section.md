## Remarks

 You can add as many Prop.  *name*  rows as you need, assign meaningful names to the rows, and set cell values. To add a shape data item to an existing Shape Data section, right-click a row and click **Insert Row** on the shortcut menu.
  
You can reference these cells by their row name, which appears in a ShapeSheet window in red text. To assign meaningful names to Prop. *name*  rows, click the row, and then type a name such as *Price*, for example, to create the row name Prop.Price. You can then reference the Label cell by using Prop.Price.Label.
  
The row name you enter must be unique within the section.
