# FillForegndTrans Cell (Fill Format Section)

Determines the transparency level for the foreground (fill) color of the shape's fill pattern.
  
|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|0 - 100  <br/> |Represents the percentage of transparency. The default is 0% (completely opaque). |
   
## Remarks

Values are rounded to the nearest half percent. A value of 100% is completely transparent. Although a shape with a completely transparent fill appears the same as a shape with no fill on the drawing page, it will interact with other objects on the page in the same ways as if its transparency is 0%.
  
You can also set this value using the slider control in the **Fill** dialog box (on the **Home** tab, in the **Shape** group, click **Fill**, and then click **Fill Options**). This value controls the value of both the background and foreground fill transparencies. To set these values independently, you must enter them in the ShapeSheet window.
